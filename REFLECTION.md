1. What did you ask Copilot to help you build? How did you break down the problem?
I asked copilot to help me build a simple website for a cafe. I broke down the problem into smaller parts like reviews and products. 

2. How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?
I became more clear in what I wanted created, being more specific in what needed to be made. 

3. What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?
How accurate the code was the first try. 

4. What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?
That AI can be useful for some things that are more challenging to build. 

5. What would you do differently if you had to build this again?
I honestly would use less AI because I want the work to feel like my own and not taken from a database that the AI uses to make the code.
